Presence of hypoxia within a tumor is spatially nonuniform, and can also by dynamic. Further, although HIF-1 is primarily stabilized and activated by lack of molecular O2, its stability is also affected by other factors present in the tumor microenvironment. HIF-1 also crosstalks with other transcription factors in co-regulating gene expression. Consequently, it is nontrivial to predict the gene expression patterns in cells in response to hypoxia, or HIF-1 activation. Additionally, cancers originating from tissue origins with different basal level of partial oxygen tension may activate HIF-1 at different threshold of hypoxia. We analyzed large published single cell RNAseq data for colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers to investigate the phenotypic outcome of HIF-1 activation in cancer cells. We found that cancers from tissues with different partial O2 tension levels exhibit HIF-1 activation at different stages of metastasis, and phenotypically respond differently to HIF-1 activation, likely by contextual co-option of different transcription factors. We experimentally confirmed these predictions by using cell lines representative of colorectal, lung, and pancreatic cancers, finding that while hypoxia enhances growth of colorectal cancer, it induces increased invasion of lung, and pancreatic cancers. Our analysis suggest that HIF-1 activation may act as a rheostat regulating downstream gene expression towards phenotypic outcomes differently in various cancers.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Liu2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Lactate in breast cancer cells is associated with evasion of hypoxia-induced cell cycle arrest and adverse patient outcome</div> <div class="author"> Yamin Liu, Yasir Suhail, Ashkan Novin, Junaid Afzal, Aditya Pant, and  Kshitiz </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Human Cell</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Tumor hypoxia is a common microenvironmental factor in breast cancers, resulting in stabilization of Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1), the master regulator of hypoxic response in cells. Metabolic adaptation by HIF-1 results in inhibition of citric acid cycle, causing accumulation of lactate in large concentrations in hypoxic cancers. Lactate can therefore serve as a secondary microenvironmental factor influencing cellular response to hypoxia. Presence of lactate can alter the hypoxic response of breast cancers in many ways, sometimes in opposite manners. Lactate stabilizes HIF-1 in oxidative condition, as well as destabilizes HIF-1 in hypoxia, increases cellular acidification, and mitigates HIF-1-driven inhibition of cellular respiration. We therefore tested the effect of lactate in MDA-MB-231 under hypoxia, finding that lactate can activate pathways associated with DNA replication, and cell cycling, as well as tissue morphogenesis associated with invasive processes. Using a bioengineered nano-patterned stromal invasion assay, we also confirmed that high lactate and induced HIF-1α gene overexpression can synergistically promote MDA-MB-231 dissemination and stromal trespass. Furthermore, using The Cancer Genome Atlas, we also surprisingly found that lactate in hypoxia promotes gene expression signatures prognosticating low survival in breast cancer patients. Our work documents that lactate accumulation contributes to increased heterogeneity in breast cancer gene expression promoting cancer growth and reducing patient survival.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Novin2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Oscillatory Hypoxia Can Induce Senescence of Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Potentiating Invasive Transformation of Breast Epithelial Cells</div> <div class="author"> Ashkan Novin, Khadija Wali, Aditya Pant, Shaofei Liu, Wenqiang Du, Yamin Liu, Lichao Wang, Ming Xu, Binsheng Wang, Yasir Suhail, and  Kshitiz </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Cancers</em>, 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Obesity is strongly associated with occurrence, metastasis, and resistance to therapy in breast cancers, which also exhibit high adipose content in the tumor microenvironment. Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASCs) are recruited to breast cancer by many mechanisms, including hypoxia, and contribute to metastatic transition of the cancer. Breast cancers are characterized by regions of hypoxia, which can be temporally unstable owing to a mismatch between oxygen supply and consumption. Using a high-sensitivity nanopatterned stromal invasion assay, we found that ASCs could promote stromal invasion of not only breast cancer cell lines but also MCF10A1, a cell line derived from untransformed breast epithelium. RNA sequencing of MCF10A1 cells conditioned with medium from ASCs revealed upregulation of genes associated with increased cell migration, chemotaxis, and metastasis. Furthermore, we found that fluctuating or oscillating hypoxia could induce senescence in ASCs, which could result in an increased invasive potential in the treated MCF10A1 cells. These findings highlight the complex interplay within the breast cancer microenvironment, hypoxia, and the role of ASCs in transforming even non-cancerous breast epithelium toward an invasive phenotype, providing insights into early metastatic events.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Ma2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Evolution of higher mesenchymal CD44 expression in the human lineage: A gene linked to cancer malignancy</div> <div class="author"> Xinghong Ma, Anasuya Dighe, Jamie Maziarz, Edwin Neumann, Eric Erkenbrack, Yuan Yuan Hei, Yansheng Liu, Yasir Suhail,  Kshitiz, Irene Pak, Andre Levchenko, and Günter P.

However, it is not yet well understood if fibroblasts are always primed to be cooperative in PDAC transition to metastasis, if they undergo transformation which ensures their cooperativity, and if such transformations are cancer-driven or intrinsic to fibroblasts. We performed a fibroblast-centric analysis of PDAC cancer, as it transitioned from the primary site to trespass stromal compartment reaching the lymph node using published single-cell RNA sequencing data by Peng et al. We have characterized the change in fibroblast response to cancer from a normal wound healing response in the initial stages to the emergence of subclasses with myofibroblast and inflammatory fibroblasts such as signatures. We have previously posited “Evolved Levels of Invasibility (ELI)”, a framework describing the evolution of stromal invasability as a selected phenotype, which explains the large and correlated reduction in stromal invasion by placental trophoblasts and cancer cells in certain mammals. Within PDAC samples, we found large changes in fibroblast subclasses at succeeding stages of PDAC progression, with the emergence of specific subclasses when cancer trespasses stroma to metastasize to proximal lymph nodes (stage IIA to IIB). Surprisingly, we found that the initial metastatic transition is accompanied by downregulation of ELI-predicted pro-resistive genes, and the emergence of a subclass of fibroblasts with ELI-predicted increased invasibility. Interestingly, this trend was also observed in stellate cells. Using a larger cohort of bulk RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas for PDAC cancers, we confirmed that genes describing this emergent fibroblast subclass are also correlated with lymph node metastasis of cancer cells. Experimental testing of selected genes characterizing pro-resistive and pro-invasive fibroblast clusters confirmed their contribution in regulating stromal invasability as a phenotype. Our data confirm that the complexity of stromal response to cancer is really a function of stage-wise emergence of distinct fibroblast clusters, characterized by distinct gene sets which confer initially a predominantly pro-resistive and then a pro-invasive property to the stroma. Stromal response therefore transitions from being tumor-limiting to a pro-metastatic state, facilitating stromal trespass and the onset of metastasis.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Menon2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Recombinant Human Proteoglycan 4 (rhPRG4) Downregulates TNFα-Stimulated NFκB Activity and FAT10 Expression in Human Corneal Epithelial Cells</div> <div class="author"> Nikhil G.

Corneal inflammation, including via the nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathway, plays a key etiological role in DED. Recombinant human proteoglycan 4 (rhPRG4) has been shown to be a clinically effective treatment for DED that has anti-inflammatory effects in corneal epithelial cells, but the underlying mechanism is still not understood. Our goal was to understand if rhPRG4 affects tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-stimulated inflammatory activity in corneal epithelial cells. We treated hTERT-immortalized corneal epithelial (hTCEpi) cells ± TNFα ± rhPRG4 and performed Western blotting on cell lysate and RNA sequencing. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that rhPRG4 had a significant effect on TNFα-mediated inflammation with potential effects on matricellular homeostasis. rhPRG4 reduced activation of key inflammatory pathways and decreased expression of transcripts for key inflammatory cytokines, interferons, interleukins, and transcription factors. TNFα treatment significantly increased phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65, and rhPRG4 significantly reduced both these effects. RNA sequencing identified human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-F adjacent transcript 10 (FAT10), a ubiquitin-like modifier protein which has not been studied in the context of DED, as a key pro-inflammatory transcript increased by TNFα and decreased by rhPRG4. These results were confirmed at the protein level. In summary, rhPRG4 is able to downregulate NFκB activity in hTCEpi cells, suggesting a potential biological mechanism by which it may act as a therapeutic for DED.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Kshitiz2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Lactate-dependent chaperone-mediated autophagy induces oscillatory HIF-1α activity promoting proliferation of hypoxic cells</div> <div class="author"> Kshitiz, Junaid Afzal, Yasir Suhail, Hao Chang, Maimon E.

These responses fall into three classes, including oscillatory activity. We identify a molecular mechanism that can account for all three response classes, implicating reactive-oxygen-species-dependent chaperone-mediated autophagy of HIF-1α in a subset of cells. Furthermore, we show that oscillatory response is modulated by the abundance of extracellular lactate in a quorum-sensing-like mechanism. We show that oscillatory HIF-1α activity rescues hypoxia-mediated inhibition of cell division and causes broad suppression of genes downregulated in cancers and activation of genes upregulated in many cancers, suggesting a mechanism for aggressive growth in a subset of hypoxic tumor cells.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Afzal2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Cardiac ultrastructure inspired matrix induces advanced metabolic and functional maturation of differentiated human cardiomyocytes</div> <div class="author"> Junaid Afzal, Yamin Liu, Wenqiang Du, Yasir Suhail, Pengyu Zong, Jianlin Feng, Visar Ajeti, Wasim A.

Previously, we have shown that fibroblasts from different species offer different levels of resistance to the invading trophoblasts as well as to cancer cell invasion. Here we present a comparative genomic investigation revealing cis-regulatory elements underlying these interspecies differences in invasibility. We identify transcription factors that regulate proinvasibility and antiinvasibility genes in stromal cells.

Invasion into stroma is a non-autonomous process for cancer, and its progression depends upon the stage of cancer, as well as the cells residing in the stroma. However, a systems framework to understand how stromal fibroblasts resist, collude, or aid cancer invasion has been lacking, limiting our understanding of the role of stromal biology in cancer metastasis. We and others have shown that gene perturbation in stromal fibroblasts can modulate cancer invasion into the stroma, highlighting the active role stroma plays in regulating its own invasion. However, cancer invasion into stroma is a complex higher-order process and consists of various sub-phenotypes that together can result in an invasion. Stromal invasion exhibits a diversity of modalities in vivo. It is not well understood if these diverse modalities are correlated, or they emanate from distinct mechanisms and if stromal biology could regulate these characteristics. These characteristics include the extent of invasion, formation, and persistence of invasive forks by cancer as opposed to a collective frontal invasion, the persistence of invading velocity by leader cells at the tip of invasive forks, etc. We posit that quantifying distinct aspects of collective invasion can provide useful suggestions about the plausible mechanisms regulating these processes, including whether the process is regulated by mechanics or by intercellular communication between stromal cells and cancer. Here, we have identified the sub-characteristics of invasion, which might be indicative of broader mechanisms regulating these processes, developed methods to quantify these metrics, and demonstrated that perturbation of stromal genes can modulate distinct aspects of collective invasion. Our results highlight that the genetic state of stromal fibroblasts can regulate complex phenomena involved in cancer dissemination and suggest that collective cancer invasion into stroma is an outcome of the complex interplay between cancer and stromal fibroblasts.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Suhail2021" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Evolved resistance to placental invasion secondarily confers increased survival in melanoma patients</div> <div class="author"> Yasir Suhail, Junaid Afzal, and  Kshitiz </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Clinical Medicine</em>, 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Mammals exhibit large differences in rates of cancer malignancy, even though the tumor formation rates may be similar.

Herein, using patient data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we report that these anti-invasive genes may be crucial in melanoma progression in human patients, and that their loss is correlated with increased cancer spread and lowered survival. Our results suggest that, surprisingly, these anti-invasive genes, which have lower expression in humans compared to species with non-invasive placentation, may potentially prevent stromal invasion, while a further reduction in their levels increases the malignancy and lethality of melanoma.

Towards this, we explicitly modeled for sampling bias in an augmented compartment model to predict epidemic dynamics. We further calculate the bias from differences in disease prediction from biased, and randomized sampling, proposing a strategy to obtain unbiased estimates. Results: Our simulations demonstrate that sampling biases in favor of patients with higher disease manifestation could significantly affect direct estimates of infection and fatality rates calculated from the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, and serological testing can partially mitigate these biased estimates.

Because metastasis has traditionally been investigated in distinct physiological compartments, the integration of these complex and interlinked aspects remains a challenge for both systems-level experimental and computational modeling of metastasis.

We also highlight the gaps in our current understanding of cancer metastasis as well as insights emerging from interdisciplinary systems biology approaches to understand this complex phenomenon. Introduction Cancer metastasis, the processes involving dissemination of cancer cells from a primary lesion to distal organs, is the principal cause of cancer lethality. Dissemination of cells from a primary tumor involves a variety of cellular mechanisms. These include invading through, or colluding with, stroma, escaping immune surveillance by inhibiting or co-opting their anti-tumor-igenic processes, evading and modulating the tissue microen-vironment, and evolving resistance to therapeutic intervention (Fischer et al., 2015; Kalluri, 2016; Li et al., 2016b; Massagué and Obenauf, 2016). Recent reports provide strong evidence that metastasis is non-linear and involves multiple parallel overlapping routes (Harper et al., 2016; Lambert et al., 2017; Te Boekhorst and Friedl, 2016). The reductive disease models that were necessary to establish the field of metastasis research and provide foundational concepts are limited in completely characterizing metastasis owing to the integrated and complex nature of its constituent processes. The multi-parametric and multiscale nature of cancer metastasis warrants a renewed focus on comprehensive experimental and computational approaches that provide systems-level insight, versus the investigation of isolated steps in a complex network of events. Systems biology approaches that result in predic-tive and testable models of complex phenotypes through integration of expertise from diverse fields including cancer biology, oncology, genetics, mathematics, bioinformatics, imaging , physics, and computer science could provide a more holistic understanding of the complete metastatic process. In this review, we present insights into the complexity of cancer metastasis, the multiscale nature of its progression, and a systems-level view of investigating the processes involved in invasive spread of cancer cells. We highlight the gaps in our understanding of steps involved in tumor metastasis and insights emerging from interdisciplinary systems biology approaches to this important cancer process.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Sam2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Single-cell connectomic analysis of adult mammalian lungs</div> <div class="author"> Micha Sam, Brickman Raredon , Taylor Sterling Adams, Yasir Suhail, Jonas Christian Schupp, Sergio Poli, Nir Neumark, Katherine L Leiby, Allison Marie Greaney, Yifan Yuan, Corey Horien, George Linderman, Alexander J Engler, Daniel J Boffa, Yuval Kluger, Ivan O Rosas, Andre Levchenko, Naftali Kaminski, and Laura E Niklason </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Science Advances</em>, 2019 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Efforts to decipher chronic lung disease and to reconstitute functional lung tissue through regenerative medicine have been hampered by an incomplete understanding of cell-cell interactions governing tissue homeostasis.

Paracrine signaling can be an important mediator of these therapeutic effects at the sites of acute or persistent injury and inflammation. As many stromal cell types, including bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSCs), display tissue-specific responses, there is a need to explore their secretory dynamics in the context of tissue and injury type. Paracrine signals are not static, and could encode contextual dynamics in the kinetic changes of the concentrations of the secreted ligands. However, precise measurement of dynamic and context-specific cellular secretory signatures, particularly in adherent cells, remains challenging. Here, by creating an experimental and computational analysis platform, we reconstructed dynamic secretory signatures of cells based on a very limited number of time points. By using this approach, we demonstrate that the secretory signatures of CD133-positive BMSCs are uniquely defined by distinct biological contexts, including signals from injured cardiac cells undergoing oxidative stress, characteristic of cardiac infarction. Furthermore, we show that the mixture of recombinant factors reproducing the dynamics of BMSC-generated secretion can mediate a highly effective rescue of cells injured by oxidative stress and an improved cardiac output. These results support the importance of the dynamic multifactorial paracrine signals in mediating remedial effects of stromal stem cells, and pave the way for stem cell-inspired cell-free treatments of cardiac and other injuries.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Padmanaban2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">E-cadherin is required for metastasis in multiple models of breast cancer</div> <div class="author"> Veena Padmanaban, Ilona Krol, Yasir Suhail, Barbara M.

Invasion of surrounding tissues and metastasis have been proposed to initiate following loss of the intercellular adhesion protein, E-cadherin1,2, on the basis of inverse correlations between in vitro migration and E-cadherin levels3. However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with the observation that most breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas and express E-cadherin in primary tumours and metastases4. To resolve this discrepancy, we tested the genetic requirement for E-cadherin in metastasis using mouse and human models of both luminal and basal invasive ductal carcinomas. Here we show that E-cadherin promotes metastasis in diverse models of invasive ductal carcinomas. While loss of E-cadherin increased invasion, it also reduced cancer cell proliferation and survival, circulating tumour cell number, seeding of cancer cells in distant organs and metastasis outgrowth. Transcriptionally, loss of E-cadherin was associated with upregulation of genes involved in transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), reactive oxygen species and apoptosis signalling pathways. At the cellular level, disseminating E-cadherin-negative cells exhibited nuclear enrichment of SMAD2/3, oxidative stress and increased apoptosis. Colony formation of E-cadherin-negative cells was rescued by inhibition of TGFβ-receptor signalling, reactive oxygen accumulation or apoptosis. Our results reveal that E-cadherin acts as a survival factor in invasive ductal carcinomas during the detachment, systemic dissemination and seeding phases of metastasis by limiting reactive oxygen-mediated apoptosis. Identifying molecular strategies to inhibit E-cadherin-mediated survival in metastatic breast cancer cells may have potential as a therapeutic approach for breast cancer.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Raredon2019" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Single-cell connectomic analysis of adult mammalian lungs</div> <div class="author"> Micha Sam Brickman Raredon , Taylor Sterling Adams, Yasir Suhail, Jonas Christian Schupp, Sergio Poli, Nir Neumark, Katherine L.

Though membrane bound proteins and small non-protein cytosolic components have been shown to be transferred between cells, the possibility of transfer of cytosolic proteins has not been clearly established, and its mechanism remains unexplained. Using a cell-cell pair of metastatic melanoma and endothelial cells, known to interact at various stages during cancer progression, we show that cytosolic proteins can indeed be transferred between heterotypic cells. Using precise relative cell patterning we provide evidence that this transfer depends on extent of the interface between heterotypic cell populations. This result is further supported by a mathematical model capturing various experimental conditions. We further demonstrate that cytosolic protein transfer can have important functional consequences for the tumor-stroma interactions, e.g., in heterotypic transfer of constitutively activated BRAF, a common melanoma associated mutation, leading to an enhanced activation of the downstream MAPK pathway.

The VLSI implementation is based on the lifting scheme for wavelet computation using the symmlet4 basis with quantized coefficients and integer fixed-point data precision to minimize hardware demands. The proposed design is driven by the need to compress neural signals recorded with high-density microelectrode arrays implanted in the cortex prior to data telemetry. Our results indicate that signal integrity is not compromised by quantization down to 5-bit filter coefficient and 10-bit data precision at intermediate stages. Furthermore, results from analog simulation and modeling show that a hardware-minimized computational core executing filter steps sequentially is advantageous over the pipeline approach commonly used in DWT implementations. The design is compared to that of a B-spline approach that minimizes the number of multipliers at the expense of increasing the number of adders. The performance demonstrates that in vivo real-time DWT computation is feasible prior to data telemetry, permitting large savings in bandwidth requirements and communication costs given the severe limitations on size, energy consumption and power dissipation of an implantable device. © 2007 IEEE.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Yang2007" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Genetically encoded molecules for inducibly inactivating CaV channels</div> <div class="author"> Tingting Yang, Yasir Suhail, Stanislava Dalton, Timothy Kernan, and Henry M.

We describe genetically encoded molecules for inducibly inhibiting CaV channels (GEMIICCs). GEMIICCs are derivatives of Rem, a Ras-like GTPase that constitutively inhibits Ca2+ currents (I Ca). C terminus-truncated Rem1-265 lost the ability to inhibit ICa owing to loss of membrane targeting. Fusing the C1 domain of protein kinase Cγ to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-Rem 1-265 generated a molecule that rapidly translocated from cytosol to plasma membrane with phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate in human embryonic kidney cells. Recombinant CaV2.2 and CaV1.2 channels were inhibited concomitantly with C1PKCγ-YFP-Rem1-265 membrane translocation. The generality of the approach was confirmed by creating a GEMIICC using rapamycin-dependent heterodimerization of YFP-FKBP-Rem 1-265 and a constitutively membrane-targeted rapamycin-binding domain. GEMIICCs reduced ICa without diminishing gating charge, thereby ruling out decreased number of surface channels and voltage-sensor immobilization as mechanisms for inhibition. We introduce small-molecule- regulated GEMIICCs as potent tools for rapidly manipulating Ca2+ signals in excitable cells. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2006</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Jin2006" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A mixture model for spike train ensemble analysis using spectral clustering</div> <div class="author"> Rong Jin, Yasir Suhail, and Karim Oweiss </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing - Proceedings</em>, 2006 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Identifying clusters of neurons with correlated spiking activity in large-size neuronal ensembles recorded with highdensity multielectrode array is an emerging problem in computational neuroscience. We propose a nonparametric approach that represents multiple neural spike trains by a mixed point process model. A spectral clustering algorithm is applied to identify the clusters of neurons through their correlated firing activities. The advantage of the proposed technique is its ability to efficiently identify large populations of neurons with correlated spiking activity independent of the temporal scale. We report the clustering performance of the algorithm applied to a complex synthesized data set and compare it to multiple clustering techniques. © 2006 IEEE.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Thomson2006" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">B-Spline vs. Lifting architecture for neuroprosthetic devices</div> <div class="author"> Kyle E.

The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) has been shown to optimally reduce the amount of data throughput, while concisely preserving the information in the data. Two factorizations, Lifting and B-spline, have been proposed for implementing the DWT in hardware. A comparison based on critical path, memory requirements, and computational hardware is drawn.

The proposed approach rests on two well studied methods for signal separation and noise suppression, namely, the denoising and function approximation capabilities of the wavelet transform, blended with signal subspace decomposition through low rank approximation. The technique targets suppression of "competing voice" type noises. A cost function is defined to obtain a "best basis" representation of the desired speech signal for which an inherent invariance property of the signal subspace is observed. This allows better separation of the speech-like noise in contrast to classical bandpass filtering currently employed in CI and HA devices. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in capturing the rapid dynamics of speech signals, while minimizing the masking effects of noise, in addition to improved recognition rates in normal hearing listeners. The technique remains to be tested on actual patients. © 2006 IEEE.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2005</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Thomson2005" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A scalable architecture for streaming neural information from implantable multichannel neuroprosthetic devices</div> <div class="author"> Kyle E.

A core computational node (CN) is designed for use in both architectures to yield maximum processor usage. The first uses multiple pipelined replicas of the CN, requiring fewer clock cycles. The second architecture reuses a single CN, thus requires less chip area but longer time delay. By utilizing the difference between the data sampling rate and available computation bandwidth, the novelty of both designs lies in the scalability to an arbitrary number of channels by interleaving the DWT computation without affecting the real-time operability. Performance comparison and overall considerations of both designs are presented in details. © 2005 IEEE.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 You R.
